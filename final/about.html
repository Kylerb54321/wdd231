  <h2>About the Founder: Kyle Bailey</h2>
  <p>
    Kyle Bailey is a dedicated and passionate rugby player currently playing 1st XV for <strong>Villagers Newton RFC</strong> in the competitive <strong>Bolands Groot Uitdaag League</strong>. His rugby journey is nothing short of inspiring.
  </p>
  <p>
    Previously, Kyle was a standout player in the prestigious <strong>Western Province Rugby Union</strong>. During his time there, he earned multiple individual accolades, including <strong>Best Forward</strong>, <strong>Most Improved Player</strong>, and <strong>Young Player of the Year</strong> — the latter for two consecutive years. Kyle also helped lead his team, <strong>Young Standards RFC</strong>, to back-to-back league championships during his two seasons with them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Following his success with Young Standards RFC, Kyle joined <strong>Newton RFC</strong>, where his skills and leadership were again instrumental. He helped the team reach the celebrated <strong>Top 12 Competition</strong> and secure a major win by claiming the <strong>Groot Uitdaag League title in 2024</strong>.

  <p>
    Kyle’s experience across competitive leagues, his deep understanding of the game, and his desire to mentor the next generation of athletes are what make Mad Rugby a truly exceptional development center.
